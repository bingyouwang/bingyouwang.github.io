I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the [College of Computer and Information Science](https://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), advised by Professor [Javed Aslam](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/jaa/). I earned my master's degree in computer science from [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) in United States and my bachelor's degree in engineering from [Northwest University](http://www.nwu.edu.cn/) in China.
